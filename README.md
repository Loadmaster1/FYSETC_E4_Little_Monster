# FYSETC_E4_Little_Monster
I know enough to be dangerous with getting a new board working with the Tevo Little Monster.  I wish to convert it from Smoothieware to Marlin using this WIFI based control board.
I receved this new E4 control board on Nov 21, 2020.  First step is to power the board up and see if can connect through the WIFI.
If you know more about settiing this up, please feel free to help.
